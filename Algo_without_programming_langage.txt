Algorithm: Analyze a Sentence Character by Character
Objective:

Count the number of characters, words, and vowels in a sentence that ends with a dot ..

Use three variables as counters.

Variables
CharacterCount = 0 (to count the number of characters)

WordCount = 0 (to count the number of words)

VowelCount = 0 (to count the number of vowels)

Steps
Initialize the three counters:

Set CharacterCount = 0

Set WordCount = 0

Set VowelCount = 0

Start reading the sentence, one character at a time.

For each character read:

Increment CharacterCount by 1.

If the character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' or their uppercase versions 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'):

Increment VowelCount by 1.

If the character is a space (' '):

Increment WordCount by 1.

Continue reading until the character is a dot ('.').

When the dot is reached:

The sentence is considered finished.

Since the last word will not be followed by a space, increment WordCount by 1 (because the last word was not counted after the last space).

Display or store the values of:

CharacterCount

WordCount

VowelCount

Example
Sentence:

nginx
Copier
Modifier
Hello world.
Characters = 12 (H, e, l, l, o, , w, o, r, l, d, .)

Words = 2 (Hello, world)

Vowels = 3 (e, o, o)

Result:

ini
Copier
Modifier
CharacterCount = 12
WordCount = 2
VowelCount = 3
